    <p>When it comes to finding the
        <strong>top bitcoin exchange</strong> it becomes difficult. Why is this so? Simply because many of the best sites to buy bitcoin
        are rather new to online trading. This means that they have had little to get the word out about their services and products.
        Most people coming to this page will be asking how to buy bitcoin online through a secure platform. Here is a good starting
        point. Let’s see how.</p>
    
    <p>First thing to consider when looking for the top bitcoin exchange is how safe are the website and server. This boils down
        to asking: is it a
        <strong>trust worthy exchange</strong> providing transparent data of coins in cold storage (more on this later) and are customers
        happy? It’s also good to lookout for which currency pairs are available: are you looking to trade bitcoin for USD, Euros,
        or other fiat currencies. The location usually gives an idea of what’s on offer. However, the
        <strong>largest bitcoin sites </strong>usually have many options for buying bitcoin with government issued currency and altcoins
        (alternative coin to bitcoin).</p>
    
    
    <p>The sheer complexity of researching
        <strong>where to trade bitcoin</strong> led me to make this blog. Although you should always do your own research before investing,
        I hope this helps. Below is the table of the best exchanges to buy bitcoin online. If you are new to cryptocurrency exchanges
        then lookout for the ‘beginner-friendy’ column.</p>
    
    
    <p>Secure exchanges that are trustworthy and have good user ratings will rank higher than their peers. Extra points are given
        for sites to buy bitcoin with paypal, as many users request this feature. Ranking preference is also given for sites
        to buy bitcoin with credit card. Check out each option on the following best bitcoin exchange list. Be sure to
        <strong>bookmark this page </strong>for future reference.</p>
