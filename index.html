    <p>This is a sample page to demonstrate how <a href="https://staticman.net">Staticman</a> can be used to integrate user-generated content into a static site. When a movie review is submitted, the data is sent to the Staticman API via Ajax, which will push it to <a href="https://github.com/eduardoboucas/popcorn">the GitHub repository</a> and cause a regeneration of the Jekyll site.</p>
    <h6>You can fork this repository and use it as a starting point to create your own Staticman integration.</h6>
