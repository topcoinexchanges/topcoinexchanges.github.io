title: Spotlight
description: >-
  The film has real insights to offer: the cast powerfully convey the
  journalistsâ€™ horror at realising the abuse stretches back decades or even
  centuries and also how abuse is as much about power as sex and that
  homosexuality is beside the point: the abusers have evolved the choice of boy
  victims because boys are reticent, more likely to swallow their shame and not
  speak out. A powerful story.
rating: '5'
